          Congaree National Park, in South Carolina, doesn’t conform to the typical picture that comes to mind when you think of a National Park. 
          It doesn’t have any of the expansive views, rugged terrain or pristine waters that define traditional park imagery. 
          It is a small, flat, muddy swamp perpetually in the shade of a broad canopy. 
          But what it lacks in glamour, it makes up for it with its incredible biodiversity. 
          The reason this parcel of land became protected and ultimately elevated from a National Monument to a Natural Park is thanks to its unique old-growth forest and the many species of reptiles, birds, mammals, and insects that thrive within in abundance, including rare fireflies.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Snakes, yellow flies, and standing brown water are not considered the most beloved offerings of nature, and indeed Congaree welcomes only about 150,000 visitors per year, compared to the more than 12 million who swarm the Great Smoky Mountains, one state over. 
          But in recent years, an unusual influx of visitors in late May surprised the Park’s staff, to the point that special access restrictions had to be put in place. 
          The reason for this unexpected pilgrimage: increased media coverage for the singular display of synchronous fireflies of the <i>Photuris frontalis</i> species. 
          That same spectacle was of course the reason for my own permit request.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In May 2019, however, the global pandemic had the extraordinary effect of closing down some parks to the public completely, and Congaree was among them. 
          But the Park’s administration, and its Chief Scientist, Dr David Shelley, in particular were eager to accommodate motivated researchers, such as myself and my field assistant Julie. 
          So much so that, after an initial first contact and a quick tour of the premises, we were given the keys to the park, literally. 
          To be precise, we were given the code to the paddle lock that kept the gate closed, and by gate I mean a modest 10-foot chain attached between two posts. 
          Still, who can boast to have ever been granted exclusive access to no less than a National Park?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Maybe “exclusive” is a strong term here. 
          On some evenings, a handful of photographers, journalists, and volunteers also scoured the woods, although I’m not sure they had the same unlimited accreditation as ours. 
          Nevertheless, there were some nights when Julie and I were the only human beings within the Park’s boundaries. 
          And in my book that is no small honor.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But being all alone in a National Park, at night, is an intimidating thing, especially at a place like Congaree crawling with life and enveloped in darkness. 
          On top of the spectacular light show that I was enjoying and studying, there was a formidable sound background, made of the very loud chorus of tree frogs and scattered by barn howls hoo-hoo and the occasional croaking that resembles a scream. 
          But the silent on es may be the most concerning: what if I were to step on a snaked while crossing the woods in the sparkling night. 
          Could I get lost, swallowed by the obscurity? 
          Was the ranger serious when he mentioned alligators?
