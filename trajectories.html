Firefly flight paths remain mysterious.
This is primarily because they move in the dark where we can't see and follow them.
Of course, their luminous streaks offer a glimpse at where they are and how they move for a fraction of a second, but they quickly vanish into obscurity.
And that might be exactly the point: by emitting brief flashes, they convey enough information for their mating dialogues, but too little for predators to follow and catch them.
</p>
<p>
  Most fireflies produce single flashes every few seconds.
  Some of them produce flash "phrases", which are regular sequences of several flashes in a row with a constant short interval between them.
  Finally, a handful of others will glow continuously for 10s to a minute.
  But even these long curves can be difficult to comprehend, since in the dark our perception of distances is impaired by the lack of contextual landmarks.
</p>
<p>
  Some long exposure photographs, which capture the background as well as many flashes in a row, can give some idea about how fireflies move.
  But the most accurate technique is to record fireflies with two cameras, which provides a 3D information of the location and shape of streaks.
  The long glowing trajectories can then be completely reconstructed.
  For the flash phrases, it is possible to extrapolate between successive flashes to form a longer trajectory.
  But for single-flashers, we can only look at separate streaks -- which sometimes have an interesting shape on their own -- since we can't know where they go after a few seconds...
